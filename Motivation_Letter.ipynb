        "**Dear [Admissions Committee / Program Coordinator / Professor ...],**\n",
        "\n",
        "I am writing to express my strong interest in joining a research or doctoral program at KAUST in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. The opportunity to contribute to one of the world’s leading research ecosystems while growing as a scientist within KAUST’s intellectually vibrant and interdisciplinary environment deeply inspires me.\n",
        "\n",
        "My academic journey began with graduate studies in Mathematical Sciences, where I investigated the stability and oscillatory behavior of nonlinear differential equations. This rigorous theoretical background significantly shaped my analytical thinking and research methodology. Over time, I expanded my expertise to applied machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and time series forecasting—both as a university lecturer and as an industry practitioner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Currently, I hold dual appointments at **Kazan Federal University** and **Finist-Soft**, where I combine academic research with the development of large-scale  systems for financial sector. I teach courses in machine learning and deep learning, have supervised over 25 student research projects, and actively publish on topics including text classification, language modeling, and predictive analytics. My work strives to bridge theory and practice—a philosophy I understand to be central to KAUST’s mission.\n",
        "\n",
        "What draws me most to KAUST is its commitment to addressing real-world challenges through scientific rigor and innovative approaches. I have been particularly inspired by recent research projects led by KAUST scholars, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **“ArabLegalEval: A Multitask Benchmark for Assessing Arabic Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models,”** which tackles the vital issue of developing and evaluating LLMs for multilingual and legally significant tasks. This aligns closely with my research in NLP and language modeling, especially in low-resource and domain-specific contexts;\n",
        "\n",
        "- **“PETScML: Second-order solvers for training regression problems in Scientific Machine Learning,”** which reflects the modern trend of integrating numerical analysis and machine learning. My foundational training in mathematics and interest in numerical methods make this project particularly compelling, especially in the development of theoretically grounded and scalable optimizers for scientific applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "I am especially eager to collaborate with renowned researchers such as **George Turkiyyah** and **David Keyes**, whose work not only advances computational science but also lays the groundwork for future interdisciplinary discoveries.\n",
        "\n",
        "My research interests include:\n",
        "- **Multilingual natural language processing**, particularly in low-resource and legal domains;\n",
        "- **Time series forecasting** and event stream modeling with a focus on interpretability and robustness;\n",
        "- **Mathematical foundations of deep learning**, including generalization theory and numerical optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "I firmly believe that KAUST’s interdisciplinary atmosphere, cutting-edge infrastructure, and visionary approach to AI research provide the ideal environment for pursuing my academic goals and contributing meaningfully to the global scientific community. In the long term, I aspire to become a PhD holder and professor—not only to advance knowledge but also to mentor and empower the next generation of AI researchers, especially those from underrepresented and developing regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to KAUST’s excellence in research and collaborating with fellow scientists in the pursuit of new discoveries.\n",
